# Overview

This app is designed to allow for on the fly balancing of the in game chat for Hll. It's written in Python, and uses the pynput library to both listen for and execute mouse events in game.  

### Volume Bars

The bars at the top of the window represent the currently set volumes in Hll. They do not reflect the values of the sliders until a hotkey action is triggered.

### Preset Sliders  

The sliders represent the target values for a triggered hotkey action. For example, setting a slider to 50 and then triggering the corresponding hotkey will start a macro which will set the ingame value to 50%.

### Log Bar

The log bar is used for relaying information important to the app, including settings saves and the progress of triggered actions.

### Info Menu

This menu displays reference to the hotkey combinations, as well as providing a link to my Buy Me A Beer page.

### Settings Menu

The resolution setting is used for the adjusting output of macros, not for displaying the app.  
There is also an option for always displaying this app over other windows.
