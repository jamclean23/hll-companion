    # Install Instructions (Subject to Change with Hosting)

    This app uses the pynput library for listening for and executing key/mouse events. As a result, it can trigger flags from most anti-virus software. Downloading homebrew software from the internet is always a toss up, and I advise you to use your best judgement when installing any software. However, the source code for the app is available on this repository, and I invite you to look through it.  
    Here are the instructions for downloading on Google Chrome and adding an exception for Windows Defender:  

    1. Install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) if you don't already have it installed.  
    2. Click here to go to the Google Drive: [Hll Companion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7emlJebSJpgXhV_slgBzGi_pQYtShHO/view?usp=sharing)  
    3. Click the download button in the upper right hand corner.  
    4. In the downloads folder, right click on hllcompanion.7zip, and extract the file.  
    5. Windows Defender will have a popup in the bottom right of the screen. Click it to open the window.  
    6. Under current threats, click the dropdown and choose "Allow on device".  
    7. You're good to go! The exe is portable, and will run from the location of your choice.
