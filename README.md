    <h2>Install Instructions (Subject to Change with Hosting)</h2>
    <p>This app uses the pynput library for listening for and executing key/mouse events. As a result, it can trigger flags from most anti-virus software. Downloading homebrew software from the internet is always a toss up, and I advise you to use your best judgement when installing any software. However, the source code for the app is available on this repository, and I invite you to look through it.</p>
